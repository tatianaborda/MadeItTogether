Goal Achievement Social Network built for ETHGlobal Paris 2023
A decentralized platform that helps people improve habits and achieve goals through financial incentives powered by blockchain technology. Users can deposit cryptocurrency and get reimbursed when they complete their missions, creating a transparent and motivating ecosystem for personal growth.

🎯 The Problem
Many people struggle to stay committed to their goals and habits. Traditional goal-setting approaches often lack proper accountability mechanisms and tangible incentives to maintain motivation over time.
💡 Our Solution
Made it Together introduces a revolutionary approach to goal achievement by combining:

Financial commitment through crypto deposits
Blockchain transparency for trustless verification
Community support for shared accountability
Smart contract automation for fair reimbursement


🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Smart Contract Deployment
Transparent and secure smart contracts govern the entire process, including challenge creation, deposit management, and mission verification.
2️⃣ User Account Creation
Users create accounts on the platform, linking their Web3 wallets for seamless participation.
3️⃣ Challenge Creation
Anyone can create custom challenges tailored to their interests and goals - from fitness activities to learning new skills.
4️⃣ Crypto Deposit
Users deposit cryptocurrency (ETH) as their commitment to the challenge. Deposits are securely held in smart contracts until mission verification.
5️⃣ Mission Completion & Verification
Upon completing missions, users can claim their deposit back through the automated verification process.
